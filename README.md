# Live_Starting_Song
a basic rock song with plugins and sections added a la V.J.

The concept here is that each instrument has it's own group whereby you can record takes on individual "Take" tracks in each group, then edit/comp the parts you like onto the Trimmed track and mute the Take tracks. All tracks route "down" toward the bottom of the group and allow effects and processing to occur at different stages in the signal flow (Pre-Amp track, Post-FX track, etc.); adjust the top-level "Group" Track Volume when mixing and keep the individual tracks in the group at unity gain (if possible). This particular set uses Positive Grid Bias Amp 2 and Bias FX 2 on the guitar "Amp Tracks, but you can replace those plugins with any amp sims you'd like (Guitar Rig, Amplitube, etc.).

The starting point file is labeled "Starting Song 01.als"—every time you make a major milestone change, save the file with an incremented number like "Starting Song 02.als", then "Starting Song 03.als"; and be sure to click "File>Collect All and Save" so that any things you add to the session get copied to the project folder.

Not much to write home about, but it is an important part of my creative workflow: staying organized and developing tools to get going doing creative things! For hundreds of years, human beings have made tools and workflows to support their creativity—take part in that tradition!

I made the tracking sheet devices shown in this video in Max to save "presets" for analog hardware as a digital version of recall/tracks sheets that can be saved with each session. I can't emphasize enough that tools/toolchains like this only need to make one person happy—find what what works for you. There are many examples of "best practices" when it comes to recording, and this video little to do with those; this is about setting yourself up so that you can stay in the creative headspace when doing creative things and staying in the tool-making/exploratory/troubleshooting/problem-solving headspace when that's appropriate.

This way—a year from now—if I decide that I took a little too much off the low end of a track when it went outboard, I can see what hardware settings I used and run it through again. Likewise, if I'm working on a track with a similar vibe to a session I've already completed, I can see what settings I used for that track and start from there instead of starting from scratch.

Hope this helps!
